this is the fourth course of the deep learning specialization

Week 1 has two homework assignments the first was to implement a CNN from scratch in numpy and the second was to build a CNN using tensorflow.

In Week 2 we built a ResNet and a MobileNet model.

Week3 involved implementing Object Detection with YOLO and Semantic Segmentation with U-Net.
